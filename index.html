    <h3>Sumary</h3>
    <p>
      I’m a roleplayer. A gamer who creates characters according to their
      classes and happily acts as them.
    </p>
    <p>“Don’t… Touch me……”</p>
    <p>“Talk more and see if you can handle my wrath……”</p>
    <p>
      My current character was a Demon Knight who kept a Demon sealed in his
      right arm! One day while I was just acting as my character and enjoying
      the game as usual……
    </p>
    <p>“Log out.”</p>
    <p>[This command cannot be carried out.]</p>
    <p>“……? Log out.”</p>
    <p>[This command cannot be carried out.]</p>
    <p>“……???”</p>
    <p>And as if not being able to log out wasn’t enough…</p>
    <p>
      “You disgusting Demon! So you finally took over Sir Demon Knight’s body!”
    </p>
    <p>“My eyes cannot be deceived! Sir Demon Knight isn’t that kind!”</p>
    <p>Because of my damn companions I couldn’t even stop role playing!</p>
    <p>
      Can this role playing gamer faithful to their setting ever return to
      reality?
